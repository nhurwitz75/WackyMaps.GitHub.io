            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>
                Many people travel internationally as tourists every year. In 2022 alone around 917 million people traveled internationally as tourists. Out of those 917 million people, many of them are illiterate in geography.
                Geographic illiteracy is the inability to comprehend, understand, and make intelligent decisions at all scales of human settlement patterns.This means that
                many people will get lost because they can not read a map, determine which way to go, and figure out how to get where they need to be.

            <h2>Target Users</h2>
            <p>
                The target users for my project are people traveling internationally as tourists. Visiting new countries means that there will be places that you are
                not familiar with. This could result in many people getting lost and not knowing how to get back on track. You are in an unfamiliar country and you may need
                help getting around.
